# CS370_ePortfolio
This repository contains my ePortfolio for CS370, showcasing my work on reinforcement learning and neural networks. It features a Q-learning-based agent navigating a maze to find a treasure. Included are the Jupyter Notebook, Python files for the maze environment and experience memory, and required libraries.
